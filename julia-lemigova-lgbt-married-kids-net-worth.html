Julia Lemigova is the first out lesbian housewife in the The Real Housewives franchise history.</span></p><p><span>She is married to famous retired pro tennis player Martina Navratilova. They are the first same-sex couple of RHOM and E! news has exclusively interviewed her about her fascinating life and family. Julia shared that she was introduced to the group by her dear friend, Adriana and said, <strong>“I couldn’t believe it at first that I’m actually going to be doing something like that and when it became real it was just this overwhelming, exciting, happy feeling to emerge myself in a completely new adventure and universe.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The model also talked about how she was grateful to Peacock and The Real Housewives of Miami for allowing her to show her family and wanted to normalize how she lived and to show that love has no gender. She said, <strong>“We are a very loving family with big and unique personalities. I cannot wait to show the world that a same-sex marriage is just like any other marriage. We will share our joy, fun and our daily life. I really want to express this to people who don’t understand that love has no gender and I’m forever grateful for The Real Housewives of Miami for giving me this opportunity to shine the light on our life.”</strong></span></p><p><span>She continued to share that she is friends with all the ladies of the show and revealed that Adriana is her longtime friend and she grew close with Nicole and Guerdy while filming.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Julia Lemigova Married Life & Kids Details</span></strong></h2><p><span>Julia Lemigova was first involved romantically with one of the wealthiest man in Europe, Edouard Stern who was also considered one of the most arrogant men. He even toyed with the idea of marrying her several times but they never got married and he had his psychoanalyst meet her to determine if she was suitable to be his wife and he said ‘No’.</span></p><p><span>However, the couple welcomed their first child, a baby boy named Maximilien together in 1999. He was playing the role of father sincerely at first but he soon found out that Julia was sleeping with three men and the baby’s father could be anyone. So, Stern cut ties with both the baby and her after the investigation but five years later, he was murdered in his Geneva home. He was tied to a chair and wearing a skin-colored latex bodysuit with four gunshots on his body and it was found that one of his mistresses, a prostitute named Cecile Brossard had shot him.</span></p><p><span>Her baby, Maximilien also faced untimely death and lived for a year only. The baby passed away in March 200 under Stern’s care. The initial reports said that the cause of death was from natural causes but a concealed autopsy report revealed that&nbsp; traces of diazepam were found in his bloodstream and the nanny also disappeared after baby’s death which makes the case more mysterious.</span></p><p><span>At the time, Julia believed someone wanted to kill the baby due to his father’s powerful connections but till today the case remained unsolved and Lemigova has talked about it saying,<strong> “It was stopped without me being able to do any further research, so it is out of my control. You cannot force these things. We could not go any further which makes my loss even more painful.”</strong></span></p><p><span>However, after all that tragedy, Julia is now happily married to her longtime girlfriend, Martina Navratilova. They first met in a gay bar in Paris 17 years ago and started dating n 2006 after reconnecting at the French Open eight years later. They got engaged after the famed athlete Martina proposed the Russian beauty in 2014. Martina shared to People at that time, <strong>“I love her dimples when she smiles. She’s got a honey voice and a honey personality. We’ve come from similar backgrounds and experiences in life and we’ve both overcome a lot. We both dreamt big and we both made it, so it’s pretty cool.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The model, Julia has two daughters, Victoria and Emma from her past relationships which she has kept pretty private after all that happened with her past public relationship.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth Of Julia Lemigova</span></strong></h2><p><span>Julia Lemigova is a former Russian model and businesswoman and reality star who has an estimated <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of $3 million.
