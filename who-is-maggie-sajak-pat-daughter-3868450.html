The revelation was made when the Celebrity Wheel of Fortune <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> account shared a promo clip for the show on May 6, which had Vanna, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mayim Bialik</strong></a>, and her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jeopardy!</a> co-host, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ken Jennings</strong></a>, playfully competing on an “Ultimate Host Night” edition of the show.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>During one sweet moment in the clip, which can be seen above, Maggie said she wants to “make Vanna proud,” to which her father replied, “I think I’m gonna cry.” Maggie, 28, has little to worry about, as she’s already making her father dad proud as a social correspondent of Wheel of Fortune, which she began in 2021 ahead of the show’s 39th season, according to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. Maggie’s job is to share exclusive videos and behind-the-scenes clips, as well as interview the hosts, staff, crew, and contestants for Wheel of Fortune’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>social media accounts</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I’m excited about the opportunity to bring an insider’s look at the show with new behind-the-scenes features, interviews, videos, and insights. The Wheel of Fortune staff and crew have always been like an extended family, and I’m thrilled to be working with them,” Maggie said in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>statement</a> about her new Wheel of Fortune gig at the time. In addition to working for Jeopardy, Maggie is also a talented singer and college student! Read on to learn five things about Maggie Sajak.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/maggie-sajak-5-things-to-know-shutterstock-embed.jpg><h2>1. Maggie Has Filled In For Vanna White On ‘Wheel of Fortune’ Before</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Maggie previously took on Vanna’s role in 2020 while her father was recovering from surgery. Vanna stepped in for Pat, while Maggie beautifully substituted for Vanna. “I’m happy to fill in, but you know, I could do this even better hosting the show with a Sajak,” Vanna said on the Wheel of Fortune stage, as seen in the below clip. “Everyone, please welcome Pat’s daughter, Maggie Sajak.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We’re keeping it in the family – meet our special guest letter-turner, Maggie Sajak! <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@patsajak</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#Family</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#FamilyTime</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#WheelOfFortune</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/QJCEqzuXtz</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>— Wheel of Fortune (@WheelofFortune) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>January 7, 2020</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>A smiling Maggie then came strolling into the stage in a gorgeous red dress and gave an update on her father’s health following his surgery. “He’s doing well. From the perspective of his daughter, it was a scary experience, I’m not gonna lie,” she admitted. “But he’s doing great and I know he’s so excited to be back next week.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Maggie made her Wheel of Fortune debut when she was just 1 year old. As a tiny tot, her father brought her out and introduced her to the famous letter-turner and the audience while she giggled and cooed and did her best to maintain her balance. “I’m walking a little better now, and hopefully I’m a little more eloquent than last time,” Maggie joked in the above clip. It’s safe to say the Wheel of Fortune set must feel like a second home for Maggie!</p><h2>2. Maggie Has A Brother</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Maggie is certainly the more famous sibling of Pat’s kids, as some may be surprised to know she has an older brother who was born in 1990. His name is <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Patrick</strong> </a>and he has decided to stay out of the public eye. However, in 2021, Pat <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced on Wheel of Fortune</a> in 2021 that his son earned his doctorate degree. “So you know my son, Patrick, you’ve known him all his life,” he told Vanna. “Well he’s made it through medical school, and he is now officially Dr. Sajak, and we’re all thrilled.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Maggie also shouted him out in an Instagram post at the time. “My big brother officially became a doctor today, and I am the MOST proud. Congrats @patricksajak, MD!!! she wrote alongside a beautiful image of them posing together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Maggie and Patrick are both the offspring of Pat and his second wife,<strong> Lesly Brown</strong>. He did not have children with his first wife, <strong>Sherrill Sajak</strong>.</p><h2>3. Maggie Is Studying To Be A Lawyer</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>Maggie is a woman of many talents. She proudly states in her Instagram bio that she’s studying to be a lawyer, although it’s not clear where. Her official Wheel of Fortune bio says that she graduated from Princeton University with her undergraduate degree and then enrolled in a post-graduate program at Columbia University.</p><h2>4. Maggie Once Pursued A Country Music Career</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Maggie isn’t only known for turning letters on Wheel Of Fortune. Her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first passion is music</a> and her debut single, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“First Kiss,”</a> was released in 2011 when Maggie was just 16 years old. The music video for the song was directed by CMT Music Award-winning director <strong>Trey Fanjoy</strong> in Nashville and was featured on an episode of&nbsp;Wheel Of Fortune. She also released a song titled <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Wild Boy”</a> in 2013.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“I’ve been singing my whole life and I’ve always listened to country music. It’s become a passion for me and I’ve been pursuing it professionally for the past three years,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Daily Front Row</a> in 2013 while she was a sophomore in college.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>That same year, she gushed to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Teen Vogue</a> that she’s been playing guitar since she was a kid. “When I was seven or eight, I used to play this mini acoustic guitar my grandparents gave me. Then for my 13th birthday, they gave me my first real guitar, and I haven’t stopped playing since,” Maggie recalled. “I immediately loved the ability to accompany myself and create music all on my own.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>Maggie added that she wanted to pursue music professionally her entire childhood. “It’s always been a dream of mine to be a singer,” she confirmed. “When I started playing guitar and performing more often, my passion for music became a top priority. With each new song I record and music video I release, I see my dreams becoming a reality.” However, she does not appear to have continued her singing career since 2013.</p><h2>5. Maggie Is A Proud Dog Mom</h2><p id=content-paragraph-26>The talented daughter of Pat Sajak is also a proud dog mom. She has a pomeranian named <strong>Jak</strong> that she posts about on his own <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> page. She’s even brought him to the Wheel of Fortune set!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K6orPGopxmq5Gfrqx5z5qrZpyRqrSpwMSrZGxwZm2BdnyO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./title-blueface-his-entourage-viciously-stomp-club-bouncer-in-newly-surfaced-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blueface Bouncer Beatdown Caught On Security Camera</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-demi-burnett-the-bachelor-season-23-contestant-3509375.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Demi Burnett? 5 Things About Bachelor In Paradise Star Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rick-ross-disses-nicki-minaj-new-song-meek-mill-lyrics.html>Rick Ross Disses Nicki Minaj On New Song Did He Warn Meek Mill?
