Born in Omaha, he became an African American Muslim minister and founded the Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI) and the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU).</p><p>However, on February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was assassinated in Manhattan, New York City. Six years prior, he gained national attention for speaking on behalf of the Nation of Islam, a Black nationalist group, and for his outspoken criticism of white authorities who abused their power and brutalized Black people.</p><p>Malcolm X was shot several times and died from his injuries. Muhammad Abdul Aziz, Khalil Islam, and Thomas Hagan were charged and given life sentences for their involvement in his assassination.</p><p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=# rel=bookmark>John Edwards Scandal: Engaged In An Affair With Rielle Hunter, Wife, And Kids.</a></p><h2>Malcolm X Autopsy Photos: Who Killed Him?</h2><p>Immediately after Malcolm X’s death, three men were charged with first-degree murder: Thomas Hagan, Muhammad A. Aziz, and Khalil Islam.</p><p>Although witnesses had seen them, there was no physical evidence tying Aziz or Islam to the murder.</p><p>Hagan, also known as Talmadge Hayer or Mujahid Abdul Halim, confessed to the murder and said his two co-defendants were innocent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Malcolm-X.jpg><p>On March 11, 1966, all three were found guilty and faced a life sentence. Despite doubts about their guilt, law enforcement never pursued investigations into Aziz or Islam, and the case remained closed for decades.</p><p>Aziz was eventually paroled in 1985, while Johnson was released in 1989. Hayer was released in 2010 after serving 45 years in prison.</p><p><span style=font-family:var(--global-body-font-family)>In 2021, an investigation into the case led to the dismissal of Aziz and Islam after determining that the prosecution was deeply flawed and the men did not get a fair trial. Aziz was 83 at the dismissal time, and Islam had already passed away in 2009.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Some have speculated that the FBI and NYPD were involved in Malcolm X’s assassination, and innocent people were punished.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Liz, the former Chief Researcher on the Malcolm X Project, stated that while Aziz and Islam did not quite fit the story shared through eyewitness reports and FBI informants, it seemed convenient to pin the murder charge on them.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The case was never reopened, and questions about the events leading up to Malcolm X’s death remain unanswered.</span></p><h2>Malcolm X’s Death Cause And Obituary</h2><p>The assassination of Malcolm X occurred on a sunny February day in 1965. At the time, he was only 39 years old.</p><p>Malcolm had arrived at the Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan, New York City, where he was scheduled to give a speech to an audience of about 400 people.</p><p>However, the event was disrupted by a dispute among the attendees. As Malcolm & his security team tried to restore order, an individual suddenly ran onto the stage and shot him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Malcolm-X-1.jpg><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Time</a>, two others ran up to the stage and fired. Malcolm was hit 21 times, and the incident unfolded before his pregnant wife and three daughters.</p><p>The assassination of Malcolm X was shocking and traumatic, and it raised many questions and suspicions.</p><p>In 2020, a Netflix documentary series titled “Who Killed Malcolm X?” delved into the incident and explored the possible involvement of law enforcement agencies and other groups in the assassination.</p><p><strong>Read More</strong>: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Sonia Gandhi Death News – Is She Alive Or Not?
