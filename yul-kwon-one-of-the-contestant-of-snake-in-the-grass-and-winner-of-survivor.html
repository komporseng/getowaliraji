Four former reality TV competitors are dumped into the wilderness for 36 hours in this exciting series. They have the opportunity to earn $100,000, but must first determine which among them is the impostor.&nbsp;This week, Yul Kwon will be one of four contenders appearing. He has competed in two seasons of the popular reality television series Survivor. To establish that he is not the saboteur, he has returned to another action-packed series, Snake in the Grass.</p><p>Bobby Bones will host the new series, which will feature a fresh group of candidates each week. The four competitors must determine which among them is the “snake” who is entrusted with harming the group’s progress.&nbsp;If the candidates are able to correctly identify the snake, they will divide the $100,000 prize money. If they are unable to identify the snake, he keeps the full sum.</p><h2>Ahead of the upcoming season debut of Snake in the Grass, here is all you need to know about Yul Kwon.</h2><h3>Before starring in Snake in the Grass, Yul Kwon won Survivor 13: Cook Island.</h3><p>Snake in the Grass is not Yul Kwon’s first reality television appearance. The participant appeared in two prior seasons of Survivor. In his first appearance on Survivor: Cook Island, he emerged victorious. Thirteen years later, he participated in Survivor 40: Winners at War, but did not win.&nbsp;Yul is the first Asian-American to win Survivor and is noted for his intelligent and cunning moves. On Survivor 13: Cook Island, he was so competent with his ideas and relationships that he never had to utilize the Immunity Idol he discovered on Day 5.</p><h3>Yul has worked with a number of non-profits to raise awareness about the need for minority bone marrow donors.</h3><p>After his time on Survivor, the Snake in the Grass participant worked for many non-profit organizations. In an exclusive conversation with Xfinity, he spoke candidly about the leukemia-related death of his roommate. He said that he was unable to locate a bone marrow donor. Since then, the Snake in the Grass candidate has been advocating for “more minority bone marrow donors.”&nbsp;Yul helped in Barack Obama’s campaign as well.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Yul-Kwon-3.jpg alt="Yul Kwon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In addition to his participation in the popular reality television series, Yul has an amazing career. He worked for former President Barack Obama’s campaign for some time. He also presented the PBS series America Revealed.&nbsp;This individual, aged 34, worked in product management. Yul also established his mark on the technology industry, where he worked for Facebook and Google. As a Google employee, he helped develop methods to monitor the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Furthermore, he runs a frozen yogurt franchise. Yul has also served as an attorney and a teacher at the FBI Academy.</p><h3>Yul attempts to demonstrate that he is not the snake in the season premiere of Snake in the Grass.</h3><p>In an exclusive sneak look released by Us Weekly, Yul was shown swimming as quickly as he could across the ocean to prove that he was not the saboteur. However, his competitors Earl Cole, Malcolm Freberg, and Jeff Zausch viewed him with suspicion.<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Yul-Kwon-2.jpg alt="Yul Kwon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After discovering the last key linked to the buoy, they decided to send Yul to swim across the ocean and deliver the key to Bobby before the clock ran out. Yul said during his confessional that many had concerns that he was the snake, and that he would only confirm their suspicions if he failed to finish the task. He said that he was in a “live or die” scenario. Snake in the Grass airs exclusively on NBC every Tuesday at 10:00 p.m. ET.
