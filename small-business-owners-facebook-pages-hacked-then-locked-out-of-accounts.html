They said when they got locked out of accounts, they couldn’t get answers from the social media giant.<p>Facebook can be a powerful tool to help small businesses grow.

People weren’t seeing my business when they are looking for me on Facebook.”</p><p>Naperville resident Ramello Barnes experienced similar frustrations when a hacker gained access to a business page Barnes uses for acting and comedy gigs. The hacker, posing as Barnes, solicited money from the page’s 5,000 followers.</p><p>“He’s making people think I’m stealing money,” Barnes said. “It literally had put a damper on my life, social media, to the point I was panicking. This dude is killing my career.”</p><p>Barnes said Facebook didn’t help, so he did something security experts do not advise: he paid a ransom to the hackers, a hefty price on top of the cost the hack had on his reputation.</p><p>“When I got the page back, I was able to see all the messages that he had,” Barnes said. “When I tell you he was doing damage, there were so many people talking to ‘me’ and I was like, wow.”</p><p>Mejta also didn’t get help from Facebook’s help. In fact, Facebook does not have a live customer service phone number.<br>“It was just a dead end,” Mejta said.</p><p>After the I-Team reached out to Facebook, Mejta was able to get back into his account. But because it was hacked, he said he still cannot purchase Facebook advertising.</p><p>Facebook says it “recommends regular checks and updates to your accounts …”, and also to perform a security checkup to activate alerts if someone tries to log into your account from an unrecognized device, and to enable two-factor authentication.</p><p>Mejta said he did receive emails from Facebook notifying him that his password was changed, but it was too late. He said he believes he had two-factor authentication enabled as well, so he’s baffled about his hack.</p><p>“I was thinking, what in the world kind of a person would do something like this?” Mejta said.</p><p>Facebook also has a feature where you can you can view where you’re logged in and check for any unauthorized device logins for your account.</p><p><b>MORE RESOURCES FROM FACEBOOK:</b><br>What can I do to keep my Facebook account secure?<br>How do I get alerts about unrecognized logins to Facebook?<br>About Business Manager Security Center<br>Instagram Security Center<br>Facebook Safety Center – Securing Your Account</p><p>Copyright © 2022 WLS-TV.
