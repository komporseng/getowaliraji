Authoritative sources estimate that Kathy’s net worth is over $5 million, gained in part from her appearance these days in the successful Bravo reality TV show “The Real Housewives of New Jersey”, performing in the reality show since its third season in 2011, now for over six seasons which reputedly adds $100,000&nbsp;to Kathy’s net worth every season. Such fame has no doubt been a valuable asset for Kathy, as a familiar name is really beneficial in developing her own business.</p><h3>Kathy Wakile Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>Little is known of Kathy’s life prior to her debut in “The Real Housewives of New Jersey”. However, not only does Kathy appear, but also her younger sister Rosie, cousin <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a> and cousin–in–law <a href=#>Melissa Gorga</a> are featured. Kathy Wakile has a teenage son and daughter who also take part, and their changing relationship with their mother as they grow is highlighted, often in rather confrontational scenes.</p><p>Kathy Wakile is the wife of businessman Richard “Richie” Wakile, who is also seen in the reality show. They have been married for over 20 years, and Kathy was apparently enjoying her largely stay-at-home lifestyle as a caring mother and housewife, until the invitation to be a part of “Housewives” came along. At that time only Richard was the money-earner in the family, working in the real estate business, and with gasoline suppliers and orders. However, Kathy’s involvement with the TV program didn’t see her receive any awards for her performance, but seemed to have given her confidence to widen her horizons, and take-on more responsibilities.</p><p>So to talk about her subsequent career, Kathy decided to start her own business, and now markets three product lines – she first became famous in 2012 for her Dolci Della Dea , which includes a cannoli kit, described as authentic Italian. Later the same year Kathy presented her drink product,&nbsp; Red Velvet Cosmo which, based on the desert red velvet cake, is a ready-to-pour cocktail which quickly became popular, and won a prize in a national tasting competition. Wakile has also written a cookbook – “Indulge: Delicious Little Desserts That Keep Life Real Sweet”, which has contributed to her worth too. In the middle of her catering activities, Kathy has also produced and marketed a line of jewelry, Goddess Eye Jewelry, part of the profits of which she donates to the National Brain Tumor Society.</p><p>The reality show also revealed Kathy Wakile‘s dream to found her own restaurant one day, and this she launched in September 2017, called Pizza Love – no prizes for guessing the cuisine! Her husband is also in on the investment, located in Bergen County. New Jersey.</p><p>There is little left to relate about Kathy’s personal life – she has been married to Richard since 1993. She and her daughter, Victoria&nbsp; take part in events which deal with raising awareness of brain cancer, as Victoria experienced an operation because of a brain tumor – hence the charity support. The family still lives in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3 class=toggle-head>Actress <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actress readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Devil's Filmmaker: Bohica</td><td>2003</td><td></td><td>Clown</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</td><td>2010-2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>Home & Family</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>Chopped</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself - Contestant</td></tr><tr><td>Bethenny</td><td>2013-2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>American Music Awards 2013</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Watch What Happens: Live</td><td>2011-2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself - Guest / Herself</td></tr><tr><td>Big Morning Buzz Live</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>The Wendy Williams Show</td><td>2011-2012</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself - Guest</td></tr><tr><td>The Nate Berkus Show</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1798613_Kathy-Wakile/1798613_The-Real-Housewives-of-New-Jersey-20102016.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movie_no_img.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/1798613_Kathy-Wakile/1798613_Big-Morning-Buzz-Live-2012.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqSYraCpYsSit8ilnGamlal6uLvRrZ9o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./trey-kennedy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Trey Kennedy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hallie-scruggs-daughter-of-nashville-pastor-victim-in-school-shooting.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hallie Scruggs, daughter of Nashville pastor, victim in school shooting</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rick-ross-disses-nicki-minaj-new-song-meek-mill-lyrics.html>Rick Ross Disses Nicki Minaj On New Song Did He Warn Meek Mill?
