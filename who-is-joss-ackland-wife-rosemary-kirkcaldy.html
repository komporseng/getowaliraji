Rosemary was a mother of seven and a homemaker.</p><p>Rosemary Kirkcaldy’s husband Joss Ackland was an English actor who appeared in more than 130 film, radio, and television roles. He was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for portraying Jock Delves Broughton in White Mischief.</p><h2>Who is Joss Ackland’s wife Rosemary Kirkcaldy?</h2><p>Rosemary Kirkcaldy was born to her parents in Blantyre, Malawi on January 15, 1929. She was a lovely woman who was raised under the strict hands of her parents. It is unknown who her siblings were.</p><p>Rosemary Kirkcaldy found love in her husband Joss Ackland when she was in her twenties. The couple got married in 1951 and they live a happy life. Their marriage is blessed with seven children Paul Ackland, Penelope Ackland, Samantha Ackland, Melanie Ackland, Kirsty Ackland, Antonia Ackland, and Toby Ackland, and thirty-two grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.</p><p>As the couple were living their happy life, a sudden incident occurred in 1963, where their house in Barnes caught fire. Rosemary saved their five children but broke her back when jumping from the bedroom window.</p><p>Rosemary Kirkcaldy was told she would miscarry and never walk again, but later gave birth and, after 18 months in Stoke Mandeville Hospital, walked again. Their eldest son, Paul, died of a heroin overdose in 1982, aged 29. In 2000, Rosemary was diagnosed with motor neuron disease; she died on July 25, 2002.</p><p>Source: Ghanafuo.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqKfqMBurcKko5qmlGLEqrLEZqmoq5WirrPFjKSgq6OTlrmlxY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./clint-black.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Clint Black</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-goodbye-by-kenny-rogers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Meaning Behind The Song: Goodbye by Kenny Rogers</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rick-ross-disses-nicki-minaj-new-song-meek-mill-lyrics.html>Rick Ross Disses Nicki Minaj On New Song Did He Warn Meek Mill?
