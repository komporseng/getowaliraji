Often known as the <i>"Claw,"</i> Kawhi is a four-time All-Star and has won two <i>Defensive Player of the Year</i> honors. Previously, he played for the <i>San Antonio Spurs</i>, <i>Toronto Raptors</i>, and college basketball for the San Diego State Aztecs.</p><p>Kawhi Anthony Leonard was born on <i>June 29, 1991</i>, in Los Angeles, California, the United States. The youngest of five children, Kawhi grew up with his four sisters. His father <strong>Mark Leonard</strong> was killed in <i>January 2008</i>. Meanwhile his mother, <strong>Kim Robertson</strong> is still alive.</p><p>Talking about Leonard's education, he first studied at the Canyon Spring High School and later at Martin Luther King High School. Afterward, Leonard attended San Diego State University.</p><h2>Shares two kids with his longtime Girlfriend</h2><p>The 29-year-old, Kawhi Leonard is in a longtime relationship with his partner, <a href=#><strong>Kishele Shipley</strong></a>. However, their romance is what we call an extremely low-profile celebrity dating. Leonard is off-grid regarding social media. He is neither on Twitter nor on Instagram. Therefore, many essential details about his personal life stay under the radar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/6/Kawhifam-1607237476990.jpg><p>It seems Kawhi and his girlfriend, Kishele began dating during their time at the University. Hence, the couple has been together for over a decade. They share two children. On <i>July 10, 2016</i>, their first child, a daughter named, <strong>Kaliyah Leonard</strong> was born. Likewise in 2019, Shipley gave birth to a son. Further, it is not known if Leonard and Shipley have tied their wedding knot or not.&nbsp;</p><h2>Low-Key Personal Life</h2><p>As mentioned, the NBA star prefers to keep his personal life far behind the limelight. He seems protective of his partner and his kids. However, Kawhi's girlfriend has been spotted on a few occasions. She was once seen supporting Leonard in the stands alongside her two sisters. Like Leonard, another Clippers' player, <strong>Lou Williams</strong> is also in a relationship with <a href=#><strong>Rece Mitchell</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/12/6/KawKis-1607238379918.jpg><p>There is not much information about Kishele, but she received her degree in Public Administration from San Diego. As Kawhi doesn't brag about his family life, many beautiful ladies thirst for him. Likewise, in <i>August 2020</i>, <strong>January Jones</strong>, an actress best known as <i>Betty Draper</i> in <i>Mad Men</i> publicly expressed her desire for the 6 feet 7-inch tall athlete.</p><h2>Kawhi Leonard Net Worth</h2><p>The Los Angeles Clippers' small forward, Kawhi Leonard has a net worth of <strong>$35 million</strong> as per celebrity net worth.
