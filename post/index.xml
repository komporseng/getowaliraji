そのボーカルのヨンスさんの注目度は日々上がっています。
ボーカルでありながらも、
イケメンでおしゃれである彼は、
髪型とファッションも注目されています。
ヨンスさん自身も、
ボーカルはスターであるべきと語り、
自身の見た目や発言に気を配っているようです。
Suchmosさんが成長していけばいくほど、
ヨンスさんの影響力は大きくなっていきますが、
すでに、彼と同じ髪型やファッションを意識してる方も多いみたいです。
ヨンスの韓国風の髪型 神奈川の湘南出身のヨンスさんは、
爽やかなファッションと髪型をしてます。
ヨンスさんについて調べて探すと、
「韓国」というキーワードが出てきますが、
それは彼の髪型が韓流風だからだと思います。
（決してヨンスさんが韓国出身というわけではないです）
色白で骨格がしっかりした男らしい顔立ちなので、
髪型もダンディで男らしい感じになっていて素敵です。
たまにはんにゃの金田さんに似てるという声もありますが、確かに髪型だけでいえばそっくりです。。笑
ちなみに前髪があると可愛いです！
ヨンスさんのファッションに影響を与えたのは、
ジョニーデップやジョーストラマーなどで、
決して、韓流が好きなわけではないみたいですが、
確かにパッと見、好きなそうには見えますね・・・笑
結局、自分に似合う髪型やファッションを探して、
今の感じに落ち着いたのかな？と。
長い髪も短い髪も似合うので、そこは臨機応変に流行に合わせていくのが無難かなと思います。イケメンでよかったですね。。
ヨンスがタトゥー入れた事件 少し前に、ヨンスさんがタトゥーを入れたとして、
インスタやツイッターでファンがざわざわしてました。
やはりヨンスさんには女性ファンが多いので、
我が子を見守る気持ちで応援している方が多いのでしょう。
「自分の体を傷つけるなんて！」とお母さんのようなブーイングが多数でした。。笑
ちなみにヨンスさんのタトゥーはこのような感じ。
なんのマークでしょうか？
憶測ではアメリカインディアンのシンボルモチーフのButterflyで、
蝶々で意味は「Everlasting Life （永遠の命）」だそうです。
身近で誰かが亡くなったか、もしくはバンド活動の縁担ぎ的な意味でしょうか？
このタトゥーの意味は、いつかヨンスさん自らの口で語る日がくることでしょう。
ヨンスのファッションは湘南系？ ヨンスさんのメディア衣装や、
私服などを見ていると、
アディダスのジャージを着てることが多いです。
ライブやミュージックビデオでは、
アディダスオリジナルのトラックトップを着てることが多いです。
ヨンスさんが着ているアディダスのジャケットは、
adidas originalsのATPトラックジャケットというものです。
ハマるとそればりを着る性格なのでしょうか？
あまりにも色違いを持ちすぎててびっくりですね！笑
湘南生まれ、湘南在住というステータスが魅力ですが、
確かに爽やかで涼しい色使いは魅力的です。
時には革ジャンなどを着ることもあり、
ロックスターらしい着こなしも決まっています。</description></item><item><title>Britney Spears Wore A Diamond Thong Under Wedding Dress: Video Hollywood Life</title><link>/britney-spears-diamond-thong-wedding-dress-video.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/britney-spears-diamond-thong-wedding-dress-video.html</guid><description>Britney Spears gave new meaning to the phrase “blushing bride” as she revealed she wore a “diamond thong” during her star-studded wedding to Sam Asghari!&amp;nbsp;Thepop princess newlywed took to her Instagram two days after the surprise nuptials on June 9 to share an incredible video of her special day, all while letting her 41 million fans in on her intimate underwear secret.
