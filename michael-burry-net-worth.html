Investments</h2><h3>Net Worth</h3><p>An American hedge fund manager, investor, and economist Michael Burry’s net worth as of December 2023 is a whopping <strong>$300 million</strong>.</p><p>Burry became well-known after it was revealed that he made more than a <strong>$1 billion</strong> bet against the subprime mortgage industry just ahead of the market crash.</p><p>Since he knew the market was going into recession, he made quite an unusual move to his and his investor’s benefit.</p><p>He went to global investment bank Goldman Sachs and persuaded it to sell him credit default swaps that bet against subprime deals.</p><p>Even though the bet was a loser for a long time and his firm had to make regular payments to cover his swaps, Burry’s predication later became fruitful, earning his investors <strong>$700 million</strong>.</p><p>The bet earned him a whopping <strong>$100 million</strong> personally.</p><p>Moreover, in March 2020, Michael revealed that he had purchased 3 million shares of video game retailer GameStop.</p><p>He cleverly reduced his shareholdings to 1.7 million over the next six months.</p><p>The share price of GameStop peaked at <strong>$480</strong> per share on January 28, 2021.</p><p>At that point, Burry’s 1.7 million stakes would have been worth<strong> $816 million</strong>, for which he likely paid an average of <strong>$4</strong> per share in 2020.</p><h3>Investments</h3><p>Burry founded the private investment firm Scion Capital in late 2000, which was funded by both loans from his family and inheritance.</p><p>With his clever mind, he was earning astonishing profits for his investors.</p><p>In the first year, his firm Scion was up 55% while S&P 500 fell 11.88%.</p><p>He beat the market in 2003 again, with his investments rising by 50%.</p><p>To benefit himself and his investors, Burry used a strategy of shorting overvalued tech stocks at the peak of the dot-com bubble.</p><p>And just like that, by the end of 2004, he and his company was managing more than <strong>$600 million.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Michael-Burry-Office.jpg><p>While everything was going astoundingly well, he liquidated his company to focus on personal investments.</p><p>However, in 2013 he reopened his hedge fund as Scion Asset Management.</p><p>He subsequently turned his major attention to investing in water, farmland, and gold.</p><p>Burry’s funds have made investments in Alphabet Inc. and Facebook.</p><p>In the late 2020, he predicted that Tesla would collapse as the housing market did.</p><p><strong>Read About&nbsp;<a href=#
