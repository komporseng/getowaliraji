Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad must be dispatched from the Ministry of Magic to deal with this incident and modify Aunt Marge’s memory.</strong></p><p>What book is Aunt Marge in Harry Potter? Book information</p><p>Marjorie “Marge” Dursley was a character seen in <b>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</b>. She was the Muggle sister of Vernon Dursley and the aunt of Dudley Dursley.</p><p>Simply so, Is Aunt Marge The Trunchbull? Ferris also played Miss Agatha Trunchbull in Matilda (1996), Aunt Marge in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), Mrs. Bevan in Nativity!<br>…<br>Pam Ferris.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Pamela Ferris</th></tr><tr><td>Years active</td><td>1971u2013present</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse(s)</td><td>Roger Frost u200b ( m. 1986)u200b</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Did Marge ever come down? <b>She was deflated by the Accidental Magical Reversal Squad</b> and had her memory modified.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_blew_up_Marge_in_Harry_Potter></span>Who blew up Marge in Harry Potter?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marge’s insults to the memory of both Harry Potter’s parents, James and Lily Potter, got the thirteen-year-old wizard upset, and he lost control of his magic, unintentionally casting the Inflating Charm on <b>his aunt</b>, making her blow up like a balloon and float about the room.</p><p>Also How old was Daniel Radcliffe in the 3rd Harry Potter? With two years between the third installment and the second, Radcliffe was <b>15 years old</b> by the time Prisoner of Azkaban hit theaters in June 2004.</p><p>Was Sirius Black a Death Eater? <b>Sirius was never a Death Eater</b> and, in this last moment before the big reveal, the audience is being clued in.</p><p>Why did Harry hear a woman screaming? Every time Harry is confronted with a Dementor, he hears the screams of <b>his mother as she is murdered by Lord Voldemort</b>. … He hears this moment because Dementors feed upon happiness and cause depression and despair in anyone near them. They make people relive their worst memories.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_Harry_do_to_Aunt_Marge></span>What did Harry do to Aunt Marge?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harry lost his temper and unknowingly used <b>an Inflating Charm on her</b>. Aunt Marge then blew up like a balloon, floated to the ceiling, then outside to the open sky. The Ministry of Magic eventually sent the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to retrieve and puncture her before wiping her memory of the event.</p><p>How old was Emma Watson in the first Harry Potter? At the time, Daniel Radcliffe was 11 years old when he played the titular character, Emma Watson was <b>10</b> when she portrayed Hermione Granger, and Rupert Grint was 12 when he started playing Potter’s loyal bestie, Ron Weasley.</p><p>How old was Emma Watson in each Harry Potter movie?</p><p>Emma Watson, was <b>10 when she started filming and 20 when she finished</b>. (in books/films Hermione was aged 11–17) Fun fact, Hermione was the oldest, maybe even in her year, but Emma was the youngest. Rupert Grint, Alfred Enoch and Tom Felton were 12 when filming started, and 22 when finished.</p><p>Who is Daniel Radcliffe’s wife?</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Daniel Radcliffe</th></tr><tr><td>Occupation</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Years active</td><td>1999–present</td></tr><tr><td>Partner(s)</td><td><b>Erin Darke</b> (2012–present)</td></tr><tr><td>Website</td><td>danieljradcliffe.com</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_inherited_the_black_family_fortune></span>Who inherited the black family fortune?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Sirius</b> was disowned and his younger brother, Regulus, became the heir of the Black fortune, but he joined the Death Eaters and died soon after deciding to leave the organisation.. This made Sirius the sole heir of the Black estate whether either party wished it or not.</p><p>Did Bellatrix marry Lestrange?</p><p><b>She married Rodolphus Lestrange after leaving Hogwarts</b> “because it was expected of her” to marry a pure-blood. However, Rowling stated in an interview that Bellatrix truly loved Voldemort. … At Hogwarts, she, along with her sisters, was sorted into Slytherin.</p><p>Is Regulus Black younger than Sirius? Regulus Arcturus Black (1961 – 1979) was an English pure-blood wizard, born to Orion and Walburga Black, and <b>the younger brother of Sirius Black</b>. He was a member of the noble House of Black, an old wizarding family, which probably started around the Middle Ages.</p><p>Who screamed Harry’s name? I’ve heard some interesting theories about this. It’s pretty much general consensus that the scream Harry hears while on the train back to Hogwarts in The Prisoner of Azkaban is that of his mother, Lily, just before she is murdered by <b>Voldemort</b>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_saved_Harry_on_the_train></span>Who saved Harry on the train?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sirius Black was, at that time, a known accomplice of Voldemort and Fudge didn’t want the Ministry to be blamed and hence kept Harry on his side. 2 years later when Harry is called to the Ministry for his hearing for conjuring his patronus against Dementors, Fudge knows that Harry will be backed by <b>Dumbledore</b>.</p><p>Why did the Dementors try to kiss Harry? The Dementors only target Harry specifically at the end of the book when one Dementor steps away from the rest and decides to give him the kiss <b>due to him getting in the way of capturing Sirius</b>. Lupin says earlier that the kiss is only done by the Dementors to those that “they wish to destroy utterly”.</p><p>What was Aunt Marge’s big mistake?</p><p>At Dudley’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge <b>had whacked Harry around the shins</b>… See Timeline of Dudley Dursley for more information on when exactly this would have been. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with a computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry.</p><p>What year does Hermione give talking planners? Hermione Granger gave one each to Harry Potter and Ron Weasley in <b>1995</b> as Christmas presents.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Serious_Black_good></span>Is Serious Black good?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Sirius Black was Harry Potter’s godfather and <b>an unquestionably good man</b>, but he definitely had his occasional problematic moments. … Sirius is a character who’s portrayed to be a murdering convict, broken free of Azkaban to attack and kill his godson.</p><p>Who first kissed Hermione? More Stories by Jethro Nededog. Among the many moments fans cheered for from the franchise’s final chapter, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, was the epic first kiss between <b>Ron</b> (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).</p><p>Who is wife of Tom Felton?</p><p>Has Tom Felton ever been married? <b>No, Tom has never been married</b>. Tom Felton was in a relationship with Jade Olivia Gordon for eight years – from 2008 to 2016. Jade played Tom’s character Draco Malfoy’s wife, Astoria Greengrass in the movie Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.</p><p>Who is Emma Watson’s husband?
