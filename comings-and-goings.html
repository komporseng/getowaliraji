In fact, the movers were coming the very next day. “I need to start over someplace new,” she told Cody. Everywhere she looked in Port Charles, she was reminded that since she arrived, she’d made “one mistake after another.”</p><p>First, the future Face of Deception got mixed up with Valentin and his cockamamie scheme to convince Nina that she was her long-lost daughter. Then, Cyrus plunged her into drug addiction, and Gladys preyed upon her weakness for her own gains. And that’s not even counting the one-two punch of losing both Brando and their baby.</p><p>Cody, as one naturally would, asked whether Sasha has friends in Austin…&nbsp;“friends like me.” But no, she didn’t know anyone in Texas yet. “I don’t think I’ll ever meet anyone like you ever again,” she added.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Instead of disclose that maybe, just maybe, his feelings for her ran deeper than just friendship, Cody instead revealed that he was Mac’s son. She assured Cody that Mac, or any guy, would be thrilled to hang a branch from the family tree for him. But he didn’t come out and say the one thing that might have given her pause: Shouldn’t we see if there is something special here?</p><p>Luckily, despite the fact that Sasha refused to be swayed by either Cody or Maxie — “I’m lost,” the model said —&nbsp;Sofia Mattsson, who has delivered such a knockout performance throughout her character’s travails, isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it was less than a month ago that she celebrated her fifth anniversary as a General Hospital regular, Instagramming that “I’m beyond grateful to have a workplace that feels more like family and a second home.”</p><p>Hope Sasha can get her deposit back on her place in Austin<strong>!
