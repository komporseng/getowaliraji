After becoming chief in 1816, Shaka proved to be a strong military leader, and the Zulus were soon conquering neighboring tribes and expanding their lands.</p><p>But when Shaka’s mother died in 1827, he was soon overcome with grief and mental illness. He then began killing his own people, so his half-brothers Dingane and Mhlangana murdered him to protect the Zulu people.</p><h2>1906: Ilse Koch Is Born</h2><p>Concentration camp guard and Nazi war criminal <a href=# rel=noopener>Ilse Koch</a> is born in Dresden, Germany. During World War II, Koch was known as the “Witch of Buchenwald” due to her especially cruel treatment of prisoners. She was even accused of taking the tattooed skin of murdered inmates as a souvenir. After the war, Koch was sentenced to life in prison at a hard labor camp, where she eventually took her own life in 1967.</p><h2>1975: Sara Jane Moore Attempts To Assassinate President Gerald Ford</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-371925 alt="Sara Jane Moore" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sara-jane-moore.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-371925 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Janet Fries/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Sara Jane Moore in custody after her attempt to kill President Ford.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Sara Jane Moore</a>, a 45-year-old accountant from West Virginia with radical political views, attempts to assassinate U.S. President Gerald Ford in San Francisco, California. She’d been investigated by the Secret Service earlier that year and was even charged with illegal handgun possession the day before the assassination attempt, but she wasn’t deemed a threat.</p><p>After police confiscated her gun on September 21, she purchased a new one the next morning and used it to fire a shot at the president while he was standing in a crowd outside the St. Francis Hotel. After narrowly missing, she was arrested and soon sentenced to life in prison, before being released in 2007.</p><h2>1980: Polish Solidarity Movement Begins</h2><p>The Polish Solidarity movement begins with the meeting of 36 delegates from regional trade unions in Gdańsk, Poland. Solidarity began as a worker’s movement in the 1970s that specifically fought against years of wage stagnation and unfair work practices. In the 1980s, it started to become an anti-communist social movement that attracted major popularity in Poland. After years of harsh suppression by the Polish government, Solidarity finally led to the removal of Soviet influence and opened up the country to semi-free elections.</p><h2>2006: Cassie Jo Stoddart Is Killed In The “Scream Murder”</h2><p>High school student <a href=# rel=noopener>Cassie Jo Stoddart</a> is stabbed to death by her classmates Brian Draper and Torey Adamcik in their small Idaho town. Stoddart was house sitting for her aunt and uncle when the two 16-year-old boys suddenly entered the home and stabbed her to death — while filming their vicious crime.</p><p>They claimed that the film Scream, as well as <a href=# rel=noopener>Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold</a>, inspired them to kill Stoddart. In the end, Draper and Adamcik were sentenced to life in prison for Stoddart’s murder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1u8OasGahnmK1qr%2FTqKmyZ6OavbWxzJucq2ViZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eric-musselman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eric Musselman - Bio, Career, Net Worth, Height, Married, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./southland.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Southland (TV) Cast - All Actors and Actresses</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./rick-ross-disses-nicki-minaj-new-song-meek-mill-lyrics.html>Rick Ross Disses Nicki Minaj On New Song Did He Warn Meek Mill?
